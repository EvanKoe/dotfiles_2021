After I blow up my old config on my computer, I didn't manage to reinstall it cleanly, so I created a new one : minimalist, still beautiful, and mostly usable to code in Js/ts.

This config does not use Lua, but the old vimscript language, because I don't understand how lua works anymore xD 
It uses Plug as package manager, but feel free to use the one you like be replacing the Plug instructions.

Thanks for looking at my config !
