# Neovim Lua

This is an old configuration I copied from the NvChad's github (thanks to him !). All credits go to him, I only added a few plugins and fought with Packer for a while because I don't understand a shit about it xD.

This config uses Packer as package manager.

Thanks for the attention you gave to my configs !
